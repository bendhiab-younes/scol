# Scolarit√© - College Project

## Overview
This project is a robust and dynamic web application built with PHP, designed to handle, manipulate, and present data in a user-friendly and efficient manner. The application focuses on the "Session" table from a database resembling the ISET de Sousse college's database.

## Features

### Data Filtering
The application provides advanced data filtering capabilities, allowing users to narrow down the data displayed based on specific criteria.

### Data Printing
A print-friendly view is available, formatting the data for optimal printing. Certain elements, such as specific columns, are hidden in this view for clarity and conciseness.

### User Interface
The application boasts a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to interact with the data. The interface includes a header and footer on each page, two columns for data display, and action buttons for user commands.

## Task 1: Basic OOP CRUD Operations (PHP)
The first task involves implementing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in PHP. The operations are as follows:

- **Create:** Add new sessions to the database.
- **Read:** Retrieve and display session information from the database.
- **Update:** Modify existing session data in the database.
- **Delete:** Remove sessions from the database.

## Task 2: Enhancing User Interface (JS and CSS Bootstrap)
The second task is about enhancing the user interface. This involves:

- **Filter Implementation:** Develop filters to refine the data displayed based on user preferences or criteria.
- **Styling with CSS Bootstrap:** Use Bootstrap to style the application, making it more visually appealing and user-friendly.

## Database Structure
The "Session" table in the database has the following structure:

| Field   | Type   | Constraints   |
| ------- | ------ | ------------- |
| Numero  | int    | PRIMARY KEY   |
| Annee   | char(5)| NOT NULL      |
| Sem     | char(1)| NOT NULL      |
| SemAb   | char   |               |
| Debut   | date   |               |
| Fin     | date   |               |
| Debsem  | date   |               |
| Finsem  | date   |               |
| Annea   | char(5)|               |
| Anneab  | char(5)|               |

You can find the "session.sql" file in this project, which you can use to create the 'Scolarite' database, and session table and insert initial data.
## Installation
To get this application up and running, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a PHP server environment set up (e.g., XAMPP, MAMP, or WAMP).
2. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
3. Move the project files to your server's document root directory (e.g., 'htdocs' for XAMPP).
4. Start your server software and open the project in your web browser.

## Usage
Navigate to the application in your web browser. Use the action buttons to interact with the data, and the filters to refine the data displayed. To print the data, click the 'Print' button for a print-optimized view of the data.
